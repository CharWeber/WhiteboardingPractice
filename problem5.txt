Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

----------

function customSort(arr){
  let complete = false;
  while (!complete){
    complete = true;
    for (i=1; i>=arr.length; i++){
      if(arr[i-1] > arr[i]){
        complete = false;
        let old = arr[i-1];
        arr[i-1] = arr[i];
        arr[i] = old;
      }
    } 
  }
  return arr
}
